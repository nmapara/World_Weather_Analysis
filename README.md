# World_Weather_Analysis

In this module, we learnt about weather APIs using OpenWeatherMap.
And we learnt to use the Google maps and Google direction APIs.

For the first deliverable, we generated 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, 
retrieved the nearest city and performed an API call to determine the weather.

For the second deliverable, we identified which cities had the best weather
for our user (via user input).  The user entered their minimum and maximum temp
criteria for their vacation.  We then found the cities, and the hotels in those cities 
that satisfied the criteria provided.  We developed a marker layer map with pop-up 
markers for cities in the range provided.

For the final deliverable, we created a travel itinerary by selecting four cities in Mexico.
Using the Google directions API, we plotted the directions and the city info.
